### Problem 

Given a bunch of images and descriptions of each of the new products, tasks to do:

1. Upload the new products to your online store. Images and descriptions should 
be uploaded separately, using two different web endpoints.
2. Send a report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported.

Since this process is key to your business's success, you need to make sure 
that it keeps running! Next tasks:

3. Run a script on your web server to monitor system health.
4. Send an email with an alert if the server is ever unhealthy.
